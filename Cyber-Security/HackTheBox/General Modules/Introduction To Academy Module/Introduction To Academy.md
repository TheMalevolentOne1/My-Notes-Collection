# Welcome to HTB Academy

HTB Academy's goal is to provide `high interactive` and streamlined learning that allows users to have fun while learning the content. 

The content has a `guided learning` approach and enables the user to practice the content they have learned through interactive instances.

Another important aspect of the academy is that it is `hands-on exercises` to reproduce what was covered in the section. As well as having opportunities to adapt and develop the content learned by tacking new scenarios of the same or similar concept.

Most HTB Academy modules also culminate in a `Skills Assessment` that tests the user's understanding of the whole module with a real-world example
