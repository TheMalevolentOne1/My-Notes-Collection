Web applications are interactive applications that run on web browsers. Web applications usually adopt a client-server architecture to run and handle interactions. 

They typically have front end components (i.e the website interface or "what the user sees) that run on the client-side (browser) and other back end components (web application source code) that run on the server-side (backend server/databases)

This allows organisations to host powerful applications with near-complete real-time control over their design and functionality while being accessible worldwide.

Some examples of typical web applications include online email services like Gmail, online retailers like amazon, and online word processors like Google Docs or Microsoft Word

Web Applications are not exclusive to giant providers like google and Microsoft but can be developed by any web developer and hosted online in any common hosting services to be used by anyone on the internet. this is why we have millions of web applications all over the internet with billions of users interacting every day.

# WEB APPLICATIONS VS WEBSITES

In the past, we interacted with websites that are static and cannot be changed in real-time. This means that traditional websites werre statically created to represent specific information, and this ijnformation would not change with our interaction. To change the website's content, the corresponding page has to be edited by the developers manually. These types of static pages rdo not contain functions and therefore do not produce real-changes. That type of website is also known as Web 1.0.
