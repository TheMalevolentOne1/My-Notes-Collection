# What does this book cover?

Chapter 1 - Introduces to **Internetworking**. Learning the basics of the **Open-Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model**. Written labs and plenty of review questions. It is recommended to not skip the fundamental written labs in this chapter.

Chapter 2 - Dives into Ethernet networking and standards. Data encapsulation is discussed in detail in the chapter and written labs and review questions are available too.

Chapter 3 - Discusses TCP/IP as an in-depth chapter covers the beginnings of the Internet Protocol stack and then moves onto IP addressing and understanding the difference between a network address, and broadcast address before finally ending the chapter with network troubleshooting.

Chapter 4 - Introduces to easy subnetting. Plenty of available help within the chapter, assuming the written labs and review questions are not skipped.

Chapter 5 - Learning about Variable Length Subnet Masks (VLSMs) and how to design a network using VLSMs. The chapter will conclude with summarisations of techniques and configurations. Written labs and review questions.

Chapter 6 - Introduces to the **Cisco Internetworking Operating System (IOS)** and the **command line-interface (CLI)**. The chapter covers how to turn on a router and configure the basics of the IOS, including: setting passwords, banners, etc. Hands-on labs arre provided as a way to help gain a firmer grasp of the concepts. It is recommended to complete the written labs and require questions before proceeding with the hands-on lab.

Chapter 7 - Covers management skills needed to run a Cisco IOS network, such as: backing up and restoring the IOS as well as router configuration, is covered, as are the troubleshooting tools necessary to keep a network up and running. Same as suggested in the previous lab it is recommend that the written labs and review questions are completed before hands-on labs are completed.

Chapter 8 - teaches about IP routing. Considered as a fun chapter due to the fact that the chapter contains the steps to building the first network; adding ip addresses, and route data between routers. In addition to this the chapter covers static, default, and dynamic routing, using RIP and RIPv2. The written labs and review questions, before the hands-on will help solidify the concepts.
